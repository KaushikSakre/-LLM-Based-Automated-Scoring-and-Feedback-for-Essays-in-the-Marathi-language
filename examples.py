EXAMPLE_ESSAY = """
Generally, some people thinks that the attendance is very important to students. However, I would like to say that the restriction for attendance is no longer helpful for the students. I would explain my opinion in the following essay. First of all, the classes held in university are additional for those who wants to listen to about the materials and ask a question. There are some students who have difficulties to understand the theme of classes without additional information, such as answers of their questions. However, the class materials are usually good enough, so a lot of students are fine to understand the whole class only with the materials. Thus, it does not have to restrict students to participate the real-time class with deduction of the score. Next, the classes could waste students' time. Almost every classes do not include fine quality information. Usually, the professors just read the material in their classes, and students are sleeping instead of listening to the class. This kind of class could bring a bad effect to the student. The efficiency of work is getting higher when someone is really willing to do that. So, if the student do another works, such as their homework, part-time jobs or leisure while the class time, and study about the class whenever they feels they are necessary to learn them, the whole efficiency would be higher than before. Thus, the study time for students should not be restricted by the class time. To summarize my point above, the class in university is not very helpful for every students who can understand the theme of the subject without the class, and sometimes it could be harmful for the efficiency of the works for students. By these points, I would urge that the attendance of class should be optional.

Government: Some people think that governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology. Other people disagree and think that this money should be spent on more basic needs. Which of these opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."""

EXAMPLE_ESSAY_1 = """
Government Budget Should Be Spent On Basic Areas Deciding how government should spend their budget is a difficult problem. There are several areas that need government budget, and the government have to divide the money properly. Nowadays, computer technology is considered to be quite important, so some people argue that government should spend much money in this area. On the other hand, others say that there are more basic areas which needs the money. In my opinion, there are several areas other than computer technology which government budget should be spent. 
First of all, there are people who do not have their basic life quality; that is, there are people who do not have enough money to eat, wear, or live in a house. They are in too bad circumstances and needs some help of the government. The government should help them live a better life. 
Additionally, also in the view of technology, the government should spend more money for basic science and mathematics. Many people who are talented in science choose engineering as their major rather than basic science because the money. The budget that is spent on basic science is too less; therefore, people are reluctant to major in basic science. However, basic science is literally the base of all the engineering field. It is very important to improve the quality of basic science in our country. That is the reason why government should spend their budget on the basic science instead of computer technology.
Some people may say, computer technology is developing fast and the government should follow the pace of development. However, the importance of catching up the computer technology is overestimated. Government can concentrate on improving basic science such as theoretical physics or mathematics and slowly improve the computer technology. 
To sum up, government budget should be used to help poor people and develop natural sciences. Computer technology is not an urgent problem. If the government uses the budget in more basic areas, the country will be better."""
