# LLM-Based-Automated-Scoring-and-Feedback-System-for-Marathi-Essays

Built an LLM-powered AES system to evaluate essays in Marathi, addressing the lack of assessment tools for low-resource languages. The system scores essays based on coherence, connectedness, and language quality, and provides detailed, actionable feedback to support progressive learning. Human evaluations confirmed the system's reliability, with LLaMA3-70B-8192 excelling in scoring and Gemini-1.5-Flash delivering superior feedback. This work promotes educational equity by enabling inclusive evaluation across multilingual learners in India.
