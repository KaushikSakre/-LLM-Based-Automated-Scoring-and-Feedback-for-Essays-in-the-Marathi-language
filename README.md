# LLM-Based-Automated-Scoring-and-Feedback-System-for-Marathi-Essays

Built an LLM-powered AES system to evaluate essays in Marathi, addressing the lack of assessment tools for low-resource languages. The system scores essays based on coherence, connectedness, and language quality, and provides detailed, actionable feedback to support progressive learning. Human evaluations confirmed the system's reliability, with LLaMA3-70B-8192 excelling in scoring and Gemini-1.5-Flash delivering superior feedback. This work promotes educational equity by enabling inclusive evaluation across multilingual learners in India.

The scoring system for essays received additional assessment through an evaluation performed by human evaluators. Two experienced evaluators examined 20 Marathi essays. 

A QWK score was calculated to measure the alignment between the LLM-based scores and human reference scores by comparing both sets of evaluations. QWK accuracy for LLaMA3-70B-8192 is 0.2361 and Gemini-1.5-flash is  0.1176.
